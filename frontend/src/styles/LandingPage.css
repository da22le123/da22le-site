    We want exactly 4 crosses across, 4 crosses down, with no cropping. 
    In your “should‐look” screenshot, the overall width was ≈1608px (4×402px) and height ≈1040px (4×260px). 
    So:
      • background-size: 402px 260px;
      • background-position: center center;
    If your viewport is exactly 1608×1040, you’ll see a perfect 4×4 grid. 
    If your viewport is a bit larger/smaller, “center center” keeps the grid centered so you never get a half‐cross at any edge.
